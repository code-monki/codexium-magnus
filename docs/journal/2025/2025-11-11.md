# Developer Journal - 2025-11-11

## Decisions

- **Qt 6 Migration Approach**: Decided on full C++/Qt migration with static linking under GPL-3. Project is at PoC stage, enabling a "knife-edge cutover" approach rather than phased migration.
- **UI Framework**: Selected Qt Widgets (over QML) for initial implementation, with Qt Fusion style as base.
- **Styling Strategy**: Fusion + custom stylesheets approach for modern UI appearance. Supports token-based theming system matching FR-2 requirements.
- **Default Themes**: Light, Sepia, and Dark themes as defaults, with support for user-defined custom themes.
- **Design Aesthetic**: Flat design preferred (minimal shadows, clean borders).
- **Documentation Format**: Converting all documentation from Markdown to AsciiDoc with automated build tooling for HTML, PDF, and DOCX output.
- **Diagram Format**: Using Mermaid diagrams exported to SVG (with PNG fallback) for all architectural and design diagrams.

## Progress

- Created Qt 6 Migration Path document (v2.0) with GPL-3 static linking approach
- Defined styling strategy: Fusion + custom stylesheets with token-based theming
- Established documentation migration plan: Markdown → AsciiDoc
- Set up developer journal system

## Issues Encountered

- None yet (initial planning phase)

## Technical Notes

### Qt Static Linking with GPL-3
- Qt 6 can be statically linked when application is GPL-3 licensed
- Simplifies deployment (single executable, no external DLLs)
- Requires building Qt from source with static configuration or using GPL-3 pre-built

### Styling Architecture
- ThemeManager class will manage theme switching
- Token-based color system (CSS-like variables in Qt stylesheets)
- Separate .qss files for each default theme
- Runtime theme switching without application restart
- Theme persistence via QSettings

### Documentation Toolchain
- AsciiDoctor for HTML/PDF generation
- Mermaid CLI for diagram generation
- Pandoc for DOCX conversion (optional)
- Makefile for build automation

## Progress

- ✅ Set up AsciiDoc tooling (Makefile, attributes, directory structure)
- ✅ Created developer journal system
- ✅ Converted Requirements document to AsciiDoc (updated for Qt migration)
- ✅ Converted Architecture document to AsciiDoc (updated for Qt migration)
- ✅ Converted Qt Migration Path document to AsciiDoc (added styling strategy section)
- ✅ Converted HLD document to AsciiDoc (updated for Qt migration)
- ✅ Converted Detailed Design document to AsciiDoc (updated for Qt migration, added ThemeManager section)
- ✅ Converted Implementation Plan to AsciiDoc (updated for Qt migration)
- ✅ Converted Project Rules to AsciiDoc (updated for Qt/C++ coding standards)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Test AsciiDoc build process (generate HTML, PDF, DOCX)
- [ ] Create initial Mermaid diagrams (architecture, components, theme system, migration phases)
- [ ] Verify all cross-references work correctly
- [ ] Set up Qt static build environment
- [ ] Begin Phase 1 implementation (Qt static build, CMake setup)
